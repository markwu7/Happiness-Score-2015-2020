# STAT340-Project
Analyzing Happiness Score for 153 countries during 2015-2020 using Linear regression, Tree method, K means Clustering by R. Coursework of UW Madison SP 2021 STAT 340.
## Language: R
### Course Description:
Teaches students to apply statistical methods to learn from data. Topics include one- and two-sample inference; an introduction to Bayesian inference and associated probability theory; linear and logistic regression models; the bootstrap; and cross-validation. Students use an integrated statistical computing environment to explore and analyze data, develop models, make inferences, and communicate results in a reproducible manner through a project-oriented approach to learning.

### Project Description:
The data in this project contains the Happiness Score for 153 countries along with the factors used to explain the score.T he happiness score of a country is dependent on the following factors : GDP per capitaâ€ž Healthy Life Expectancy ,Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception, and Residual error which is given in the data and on the basis of which countries are provided with the rankings with Finland being at the top. We're going to analyze the given data by using "Linear Regression", "Tree", "K means Clustering" method.
